# CTU-Final-Project
Colorado Technical University Online Senior Project

This project was to develop software from beginning to end following the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).  The project I chose was creating my own version of Pacman using Unity.  The PacManBuild.zip includes the needed files and folders to run the game.  Once the zip is download, extract the files and folders and run the exe file to play my version of Pacman.

The Pacman Files folder contains all of the files that I used to create the game.
Pacman Files > Assets > Scripts (contains all of the code I used to make the game).
