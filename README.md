# CTU-Final-Project
Colorado Technical University Online Senior Project

This project was to develop software from beginning to end following the SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle).  The project I chose was creating my own version of Pacman.  This zip includes the needed files and folders to run the game.  Once the zip is download, extract the files and folders and run the exe file.
